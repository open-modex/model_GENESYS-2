# GENESYS v2.0 - European Power System Model & Transformation Optimisation
========================

GENESYS v2 is an optimisation tool for the optimisation of the transformation and operation of the European Power System. It is implemented using the CMA-ES Optimiser {(1) Nikolaus Hansen et.al.}, with the implementation of libcmaes by {(2)Emmanuel Benazera}

GENESYS v2 is based on the ideas and experience from a prior research project (GENESYS v1) which aimed at the study of possible realisation of a fully renewable power system for EUMENA.

GENESYS v2 is implemented by RWTH Aachen University within a collaboration of the Institute for Power Generation and Storage Systems (PGS/ISEA) and the Institute of Power Systems and Power Economics (IAEW).
